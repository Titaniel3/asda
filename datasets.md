## Dateset 1: Online Chess Games
**Description:** This is a Dataset containing 20,058 chess games from the Online Chess-Site Lichess.org. The Dataset includes the following variables: 
- Game ID
- Rated (T/F)
- Start Time
- End Time
- Number of Turns
- Game Status
- Winner
- Time Increment
- White Player ID
- White Player Rating
- Black Player ID
- Black Player Rating
- All Moves in Standard Chess Notation
- Opening Eco (Standardised Code for any given opening, list here)
- Opening Name
- Opening Ply (Number of moves in the opening phase)

**Why did I choose this Dataset**: I’ve been passionate about chess since I was a kid — and pretty good at it, too! For almost two years now, I’ve been running a chess YouTube channel with some colleagues, which has already grown to over 22,000 subscribers. So it is safe to say that I love the game of chess. And not only the game, but also the data behind it. Chess is a very data-driven game: How many moves of opening theory did I play? How long did I spend on average for the critical moments? How was my quality of play in general (can be measured with *average centipawn-loss*, which is calculated by strong chess engines. How well do I perform in different phases of the game (Opening, Middlegame or Endgame). These are only some questions in chess that can be answered by looking at the data from games. 
I chose this data set specifically, because it is a rather small data set (there are also chess data sets with *over 7 billion* games!). That is why I expect this Dataset to be beginner-friendly and easier to analyze with my current skill set in Data Science. Later, I want to be able to also work with larger and more complex chess Datasets to be able to maybe find some patterns between some of the variables.
